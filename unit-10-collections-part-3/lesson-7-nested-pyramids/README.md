# Nested Pyramid

Write a function `nested_pyramid` that receives a number `height` and a character `char` and builds an ASCII Pyramid with them. Examples:

**A pyramid with 5 levels:**
```python
nested_pyramid(5, '*')
*
**
***
****
*****
```

**A pyramid with 3 levels:**
```python
nested_pyramid(3, '#')
#

###
```
