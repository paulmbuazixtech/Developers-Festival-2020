### The `assert` statement

The `assert` statement allows us to verify that our code works as expected, in a simple and reliable way. Python interprets `assert` as we'd do: "make sure this current statement is true". Examples:

```python
assert 2 + 2 == 4  # make sure "two plus two is equals to four"
assert add(2, 3) == 5  # make sure that "if we invoke add with 2 and 3, the result is 5"
```

This makes it a really powerful statement and a really useful one to verify our code works. We can just write the expected output of our functions with asserts, and then sit to code the actual function.
