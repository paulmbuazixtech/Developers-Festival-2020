# Make a Car that can Drive!


Create a class `Car` that is initialized by providing one mandatory argument: `electric`.
It will have a method called `drive` that returns the sound the car makes.
Make sure the text for the sound output matches the example.
You can access the attributes in the `drive` method from the self variable. 

Example:

```python
car1 = Car(electric=False)
print(car1.electric)  # False
print(car1.drive())  # 'VROOOOM'

car2 = Car(electric=True)
print(car2.electric)  # True
print(car2.drive())  # 'WHIRRRRRRR'
```
