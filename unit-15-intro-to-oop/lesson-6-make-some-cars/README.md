# Make Some Cars

Create a class `Car` and create two instances `car1` and `car2`. Then set three attributes for the instances: `color`, `make`, and `model`. Set whatever value you want for those attributes, but make sure they're different from `car1` to `car2` (i.e. `car1` can't have the same color than `car2`).
