# Comma Code

Write a function that takes a list value as an argument
and returns a string with all the items separated
by a comma and a space, with 'and' inserted before the last item.

Example:

```python
comma_code(['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats']) # 'apples, bananas, tofu and cats'
comma_code(['apples', 'bananas']) # 'apples and bananas'
```

This assignment is also designed to be resolved with a `reduce` function, but use your common sense to judge it.
