# Function Factorial

The objective of this assignment is to write a factorial function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial).

In order to do that we'll define 2 helper functions:

* `factorial_terms`: will receive a number and return the list of terms to compute the factorial.
* `compute_factorial`: Will receive a list of terms and compute de factorial.

Finally, the `factorial` function will get a number and, using both helper functions, will compute
the answer.

This assignment is designed to practice the `reduce` function. But if you think it's getting too complicated, you can just try using a for-loop and check the solution later. 

Use the tests to see the complete specification of what you're required to write.
