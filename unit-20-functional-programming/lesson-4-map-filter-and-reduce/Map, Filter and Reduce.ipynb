    "### Reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to talk about reduce. But before I explain how reduce works, I need to give you a few conceptual warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, `reduce` isn't nearly as popular as `map` and `filter`. I've personally seen `reduce` correctly and beneficially applied only a handful of times (and I've been coding for a really long time). Even more, Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, is against the irresponsible use of `reduce`, saying:\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is actually the one I've always hated most, because, apart from a few examples involving + or *, almost every time I see a reduce() call with a non-trivial function argument, I need to grab pen and paper to diagram what's actually being fed into that function before I understand what the reduce() is supposed to do...\n",
    "\n",
    "[Read the full article here](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196)\n",
    "\n",
    "So Guido (and the Python team) considered `reduce` so harmful (when incorrectly used) that they decided to remove it from the standard library in Python 3. That means that, in Python 2 you can just type `reduce` in your interpreter (without any imports) and it'll just work. In Python 3, you need to **explicitly** import it from the `functools` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how reduce work? Reduce, similarly to `map` and `filter` takes two arguments: a function and a collection. But in contrast to its cousins, `reduce` **does NOT** return a new collection: **it returns a single element**, usually, by combining the original elements all into one (\"associative operators\", as Guido says).\n",
