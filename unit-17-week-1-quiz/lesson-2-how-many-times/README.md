# How many times

Write a function `how_many_times` that receives a string (like a short sentence text) and a word and returns the number of times that word is repeated in the sentence. Example, given the following sentence:

> Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgement that something else is more important than fear
_(Ambrose Redmoon)_

How many times was the word `fear` used?

Your `how_many_times` function will exactly answer that. 

Example:

```python
phrase = "Python is a great language. I like Python a lot."
how_many_times(phrase, "Python")  # Returns 2
```

_**Hint**: check special methods of strings._
