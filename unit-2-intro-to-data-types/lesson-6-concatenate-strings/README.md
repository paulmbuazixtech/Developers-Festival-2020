# Concatenate Strings

Strings support different operators, the most common one being the _plus sign_ (`+`). Complete the code in the editor to concatenate the strings given (`hello` and `world`) to form the final string `"Hello World"`.

**Hint**: Make sure you're including the space between the words.
