# Fun with Strings

Please complete the code to include the two placeholder variables (`your_name` and `length_of_rmotr_domain`).

The variable `your_name` is simple, just put your name as a String. You can use single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`), it's your choice. In Python it's the same.

The other variable is `length_of_rmotr_domain`. It's a little bit more complicated. We want you to save in that variable a number that represents the length of the previously defined `rmotr_domain` variable. The simple answer is 9, because `rmotr.com` has 9 characters. But we want you to compute it dynamically, counting how many characters there are in the `rmotr_domain` variable.
