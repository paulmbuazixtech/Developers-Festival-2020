# Area of Circle

Time for the `math` library. It has a lot of mathematical methods and numbers. Surprised?

Suppose you wanted to calculate the area of a circle with more precision and you didn't have pi memorized to 100 digits like most people do. You could either start learning about pi... or just use the `math` library!

Okay... time to make that hypothetical area of a circle program less hypothetical. 

Create a function `area_of_circle` that receives the `radius` and returns the area of the circle (pi * r * r) using the `math` library to get your value for pi.



Examples:

```python
area_of_circle(1) #  3.141592653589793

area_of_circle(2) # 12.566370614359172
```
