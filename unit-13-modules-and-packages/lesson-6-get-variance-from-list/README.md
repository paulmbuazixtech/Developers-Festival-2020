# Get Variance from List

Perhaps you need to calculate some statistics on data you have.

You COULD write your own code to do this. But you are a strong, confident, successful programmer with a busy schedule and ain't nobody got time for dat (unless you want the practice).  

Import the [`statistics`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html) library and write a function `get_variance_from_list` that receives the list `a_list` and returns the variance for the numbers in that list using a method from the library.

Note: This particular library only works in python versions 3.4 and greater. Make sure when you run this code you have it set to Python 3 in the platform (button in top right on Learn)!

Examples:

```python
get_variance_from_list([1, 3, 8, 4, 22]) # 71.3
```
