# Celebrate if Friday

Now that you are more familiar with formatting dates as strings, it's time to do something with that knowledge. 

Make a simple function called `celebrate_if_friday` that checks `a_date` that is passed to it and sees if it is Friday. If it is, return a string that says "YES!" and return a string that says "Aww" if not.

Examples:

```python
celebrate_if_friday(date(2018, 1, 5)) # "YES!"

celebrate_if_friday(date(1987, 9, 29)) # "Aww"
```
