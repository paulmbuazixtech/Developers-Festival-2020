# Your first function

Let's start writing a **really** simple (close to dumb) function. We want you to completely understand the syntax and wrap your mind around them.

At the editor at the right you'll see a simple function defined. That's a valid python function. Now replace the empty string with your name (we'll learn more about strings later). For me, the function looks something like this:

```python
def return_your_name():
    return 'Santiago'
```

### Try the function

Now try uncommenting the lines at the bottom of the editor and using the _Run Code_ button to see how it works. You should see your name printed out in the screen. Both examples (1 and 2) **are identical**. They're doing the same thing. The only difference is that the first one is just storing the value returned by the `return_your_name` function in an intermediate variable.
