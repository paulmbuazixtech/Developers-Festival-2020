# Invoking Functions

The first step to understand functions from a practical standpoint is using them. The fancy tech name we give to the action of "using" a function is "_invoke_ a function". Python has many functions that we can just use out of the box. For example, `print` is a function (**check the notes below**) that lets you send characters to the console. Let's see a few different examples of _invoking_ the `print` function:

```python
print("Hello World")
print(42)

my_name = "Santiago"
print(my_name)

print("Santiago")
```

In this case, the function name is `print`. The only parameter that it receives is "something to print". So we invoke `print` passing as an argument that thing that we want to print in the screen.

Check the examples in the editor and complete the assignment: use the `len` and `sum` function to calculate `length_of_hello_world` and `sum_of_first_10_numbers`.
