# Function arguments

We're going to explore how to receive parameters and operate with them in your functions. In the editor you'll see a simple function that accepts just one parameter (named `x` in this case). This function's job is to multiply `x` by 2 and return the result. For example, if we pass 3 as the parameter, we're going to receive `3 * 2` as the result:

```python
multiply_by_two(3)  # 6
```

Parameters are matched by position. In this case `multiply_by_two` receives only one parameter (`x`), so when we invoke it passing the number `3`, it gets assigned to `x`.

Now go ahead and try implementing the `multiply_by_two` function by yourself.
