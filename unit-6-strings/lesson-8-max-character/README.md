# Max character

Write a function `max_char` that receives a string and returns the "maximum" character in it. Max is defined as `a < b < ... < z` ignoring uppercase chars (all strings provided will be lowercase). **Important:** If the string received is empty, the result should be an empty string. Example:

```python
max_char('azg')  # 'z'
max_char('')  # ''
```
