# Convert Pirate to Dog

Today we're going to write a function to convert what a pirate would say into the way a dog would say it. Roo roo roo roo!

Complete the function `convert_pirate_to_dog` with a for loop so that it goes through each letter of `pirate_saying` and then adds 'oo' after each letter.

Remember that strings are immutable, so you will have to create a new string for the result of how a dog would sound. 

Examples:

```python
>>>  convert_pirate_to_dog("arrrr")
'aoorooroorooroo'
```

Hint: To add letters to the result string, use the += operator.
