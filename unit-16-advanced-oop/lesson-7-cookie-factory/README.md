# Cookie Factory

Create a class `Cookie` with a class method `create_cookies` that receives a number as parameter and creates that amount of cookies. Example:

```python
Cookie.create_cookies(3)
[<Cookie object>, <Cookie object>, <Cookie object>]

Cookie.create_cookies(1)
[<Cookie object>]

Cookie.create_cookies(5)
[<Cookie object>, <Cookie object>, <Cookie object>, <Cookie object>, <Cookie object>]
```
