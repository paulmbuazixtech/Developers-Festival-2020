# Get Average

Complete the function `get_average` so that it returns the average of all the numbers
in `list_of_numbers`. 

You'll need to use a for loop to calculate the `total` value of all the numbers added together.

Then divide the `total` by the amount of items in your list to get your average.

Hint: You'll need a variable to keep track of the `total`. You need to figure out whether that variable
belongs inside or outside the for loop.
