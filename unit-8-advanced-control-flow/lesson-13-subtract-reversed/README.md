# Subtract Reversed

Using a **while loop**, write a function `subtract_reversed` that receives a list and subtracts all the numbers, starting from the end. Example:

```python
subtract_reversed([3, 7, 18]) # Result: 8 (which is equals to: 18 - 7 - 3)
subtract_reversed([9]) # Result: 9 (which is equals to: 9 - 0)
```

**Special case**: If the list is empty, should return 0. Check the tests for details.
