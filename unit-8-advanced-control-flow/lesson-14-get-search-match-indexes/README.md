# Get Search Match Indexes

It's time to search our `list_being_frisked` for "suspicious" items. We want you to
return the a new list containing the indexes of any items that match the string "suspicious".

Hint: You'll need to keep track of the index and create a new list to store the indexes in.

Good luck! You wanted to work for the TSA, right?
