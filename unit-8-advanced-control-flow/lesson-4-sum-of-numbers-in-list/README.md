# Sum of numbers in list

Define a function `sum_of_numbers_in_list` that receives a list of numbers 
`a_list` of an unknown length and calculates the sum of those numbers using a 
for loop. Do not use the sum function.


Examples:

```python
>>> sum_of_numbers_in_list([])
0
>>> sum_of_numbers_in_list([4])
4
>>> sum_of_numbers_in_list([2, 3])
5
>>> sum_of_numbers_in_list([2, 3, 4])
9
```
