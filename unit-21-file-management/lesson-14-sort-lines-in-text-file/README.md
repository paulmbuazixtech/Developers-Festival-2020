# Sort Lines in Text File

Write a function that receives the path to a text file and sorts all the
lines in the file ascending or descending, depending on the 'sorting'
parameter. The file will be overwritten with the new order.

Example:

```python
sort_lines('file1.txt', sorting='asc')
sort_lines('file1.txt', sorting='desc')
```
