# Count Lines Starting with each Letter

Write a function that receives the path to a text file that contains JUST ONE word
per line, and returns a dictionary with the counter of words starting with each
letter from 'a' to 'z'.

Example:

```python
counter_by_letter('words.txt')  
# {
'a': 2,
'b': 10,
'c': 0,
...
'z': 1
}
```
