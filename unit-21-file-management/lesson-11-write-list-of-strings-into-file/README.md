# Write List of Strings into File

Write a function that receives a path to a text file as first parameter and
a list of string as second one. The function should write each string in a new
line of the text file. If 5 strings are given in the list, the resulting file
should have 5 lines.

Example:

```python
write_lines('test-file.txt', ['hello', 'world'])
```
