# Create List with Literals

You don't always have to put variables in your lists. You can also just directly
put data in there.

Example:

```python
fancy_list = ["i am data that is not stored in a variable! OMG!"]
```

Want to know something cool? Lists are very progressive!
They are **heterogeneous** and support diversity! That means that you can put
multiple data types inside the same list. Integers, booleans, strings, floats, other lists, everything is good here! Safe space.

For this assignment, create a list named `heterogeneous` and put an integer, a string, and a boolean in it. **In that order**.
