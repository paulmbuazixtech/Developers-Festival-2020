# Create List with One Element

Great news! You have been given a special opportunity to make another list! Yes!

This time, create one **with just one element** or item in it. You also need to count how many elements the list `my_list` has with the `len` function: it's obviously 1 ;)

For this assignment, we will make that item be a predefined variable about chickens.

Good luck.
