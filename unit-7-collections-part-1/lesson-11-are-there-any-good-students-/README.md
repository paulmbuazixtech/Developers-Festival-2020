# Check for Something in List

When Christmas rolls around, everybody knows Santiago, AKA Santa,
has to check his list twice.

Lets help him do that!

Create a function that uses the keyword `in` to verify if there are any good
students in his list. Check for the string `good_student` and return `True` or `False`
depending if it is present.
