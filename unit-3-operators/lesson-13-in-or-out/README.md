# In or out

The `in` keyword is used to determine if something is part of something else. 

For now, we can use it to check if a letter or string is part of another string.

```python
print('c' in 'cat') # True
print('z' in 'dog') # False
print('ham' in 'hamster') # True
```

Use the `in` keyword to complete the following statements.
