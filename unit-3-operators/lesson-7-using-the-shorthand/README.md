# Using the shorthand

Experienced programmers tend to try and type as little as possible to accomplish their goals (so long as it is readable). 

As a result, it's important for you to be familiar with and use the shorthand for when you have a variable and you are performing a math operation on itself!

`var += 1  is shorthand for  var = var + 1`
`var -= 3  is shorthand for  var = var - 3`
`var *= 5  is shorthand for  var = var * 5`
`var /= 2  is shorthand for  var = var / 2`

Use this shorthand to follow the steps in the comments to perform the math operations on the variable 'change_me'.
