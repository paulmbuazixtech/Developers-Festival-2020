# And now this
# And Now This

The `and` operator checks that the boolean conditions on both sides of it are True. You can combine multiple and statements together if you need more than two conditions to be checked.

```python
true_condition = True
false_condition = False
santiagos_birthday = False

result1 = true_condition and false_condition # False, because both sides aren't True
# Two `and` keywords to check three conditions
result2 = true_condition and not false_condition and not santiagos_birthday # True
```

Complete the code to practice with some `and` statements.
