# Greater or less than

Just like the equals/not equals operators, when comparing numbers you can check if they are greater or less than each other. 

Your toolkit: `<, >, <=, >=` 

Note that the for `<=` and `>=` the equal sign comes AFTER the `<` or `>`, kind of similar to the shorthand in the previous assignment.

Complete the code for some practice.
