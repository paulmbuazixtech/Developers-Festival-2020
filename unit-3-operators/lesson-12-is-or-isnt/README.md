# Is or isn't

Much like the equals/not equals operator, there is the `is` and `is not` operator. 

For now, use the `is` keyword instead of `==` and `is not` instead of `!=` when checking equality of booleans and the None datatype as a more semantic way of checking equality. For numbers and strings, it's still best to use `==` and `!=`.

Practice time!
