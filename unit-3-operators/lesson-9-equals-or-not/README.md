# Equals or not

As you dive more into programming, you'll find that you start having dynamic variables where you don't necessarily know what they are at a given moment in your program. The equals/not equals operators help you determine if a variable is what it needs to be for something to happen.

Reminder: If there is only one equals sign `=` as the operator, it's storing information in a variable. If there are two equals signs `==`, it is checking if the left side and right side match. If it is `!=`, it is checking if the left and right side do not match.

When checking for equality, it will give you a boolean answer (True or False). Follow the comments to complete the code.
