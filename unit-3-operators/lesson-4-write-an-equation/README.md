# Write an equation!

Okay, now that you've proved you can do basic math operations, let's put you to the test.

Write the equation to get the average of the numbers 3, 5, and 7. Remember, you'll have to add them all together first, and then divide them by how many numbers you're taking the average of (3 in this case).

Hint: You'll need parenthesis around the addition part as order of operations in math is important in Python too! Let Python do the math for you!
